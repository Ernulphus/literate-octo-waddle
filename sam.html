  <p>
    Sam has a broad range of knowledge in history, politics, computer science, linguistics,<br>
    and many other subjects. They have strong opinions that they don't mind sharing.<br>
    This makes them very interesting to talk with.<br>
    They're also better than me in age of empires 2 but they're not mean about it.<br>
